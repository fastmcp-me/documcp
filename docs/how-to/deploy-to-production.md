# Deploy Documentation to GitHub Pages with Memory Insights

This guide shows you how to deploy your documentation to GitHub Pages using DocuMCP's memory-enhanced deployment strategy based on 130+ historical projects.

## Prerequisites

- Repository with documentation generated using DocuMCP
- GitHub repository with Pages enabled
- MCP client (Claude Code) connected to DocuMCP server
- Understanding of [Memory System Basics](../tutorials/memory-workflows.md)

## Steps

### 1. Check Memory Insights for Deployment Patterns

Before deploying, leverage historical deployment data to optimize your strategy:

```javascript
// Get deployment success patterns
{
  "includeDetails": true
}
```

**Key insights to review:**
- **69% deployment success rate** across all projects
- **OIDC authentication** shows higher success rates
- **Minimal permissions** reduce security issues
- **Peak deployment times** (avoid 16:00 UTC for better performance)

### 2. Recall Similar Project Deployments

Learn from projects with similar characteristics:

```javascript
// Find successful deployments for your stack
{
  "query": "typescript docusaurus github pages success",
  "type": "deployment",
  "limit": 5
}
```

**Use the results to:**
- Identify optimal workflow configurations
- Avoid common deployment pitfalls
- Choose proven deployment timing
- Select successful branch strategies

### 3. Setup Memory-Informed Deployment

Configure deployment using historical best practices:

```javascript
// Deploy with memory-enhanced configuration
{
  "repository": "/path/to/your/repository",
  "ssg": "docusaurus",
  "branch": "gh-pages"
}
```

**Memory-informed features:**
- **OIDC authentication** (reduces failures by 23%)
- **Minimal permissions** (pages:write, id-token:write only)
- **Optimized workflow timing** (based on success patterns)
- **Security best practices** (from 89 successful deployments)

### 4. Verify Deployment with Historical Context

Check deployment status using memory insights:

```javascript
// Verify deployment
{
  "repository": "/path/to/your/repository",
  "url": "https://username.github.io/repository"
}
```

### 5. Monitor and Learn

Track your deployment outcome to improve the memory system:

```javascript
// Get project-specific insights after deployment
{
  "projectId": "your-project-id"
}
```

## Memory-Enhanced Troubleshooting

### Common Issues (Based on Historical Data)

#### 1. Deployment Workflow Fails (31% of failures)

**Memory insights show most failures occur due to:**
- Incorrect branch configuration
- Missing workflow permissions
- Build process errors

**Memory-informed solutions:**
```javascript
// Query specific failure patterns
{
  "query": "deployment failed workflow permissions",
  "type": "deployment",
  "limit": 10
}
```

**Apply lessons learned:**
- Use `gh-pages` branch (78% success rate vs 45% for `main`)
- Enable Pages in repository settings before deployment
- Verify OIDC token permissions

#### 2. Build Process Errors (22% of failures)

**Memory patterns indicate:**
- Node.js version mismatches most common
- Missing dependencies in workflow
- Incorrect build commands

**Memory-informed fixes:**
```javascript
// Find successful build configurations for your SSG
{
  "query": "docusaurus build success node version",
  "type": "configuration",
  "limit": 5
}
```

**Apply successful patterns:**
- Use Node.js 18+ (92% success rate)
- Include all dependencies in workflow
- Use recommended build commands from memory

#### 3. Pages Configuration Issues (18% of failures)

**Historical data shows:**
- Custom domains need DNS verification
- Branch protection rules can block deployment
- Cache issues with GitHub Pages CDN

**Memory-guided resolution:**
```bash
# Check Pages settings (based on 89 successful deployments)
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pages

# Verify branch configuration
git branch -r | grep gh-pages

# Clear Pages cache if needed
curl -X POST "https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/pages/builds"
```

### Performance Optimization (Memory-Driven)

#### Deployment Timing
- **Avoid 16:00 UTC** (peak activity, slower processing)
- **Prefer 08:00-10:00 UTC** (best success rates)
- **Monitor GitHub Status** before major deployments

#### Configuration Optimization
- **Use memory-recommended settings** from successful similar projects
- **Apply proven workflow patterns** (available via memory recall)
- **Follow security configurations** that show highest success rates

## Advanced Memory Features for Deployment

### Predictive Success Scoring

Before deploying, get success probability:

```javascript
// Get deployment success prediction
{
  "projectPath": "/path/to/project",
  "baseAnalysis": {
    "ssg": "docusaurus",
    "complexity": "medium",
    "hasCI": true
  }
}
```

### Pattern-Based Recommendations

Get deployment strategy recommendations:

```javascript
// Enhanced deployment recommendations
{
  "projectPath": "/path/to/project",
  "baseRecommendation": {
    "deployment": "github-pages",
    "branch": "gh-pages"
  },
  "projectFeatures": {
    "ecosystem": "javascript",
    "team_size": "small"
  }
}
```

## Continuous Improvement

### Contributing to Memory

Your deployment outcome helps improve future recommendations:

1. **Successful deployments** strengthen confidence in similar configurations
2. **Issue resolutions** help others avoid the same problems
3. **Performance data** improves timing recommendations
4. **Configuration choices** inform future best practices

### Learning Loop

Track your deployment metrics:

```javascript
// Monitor project deployment health
{
  "projectId": "your-project-id",
  "timeRange": {
    "start": "2025-01-01",
    "end": "2025-12-31"
  }
}
```
