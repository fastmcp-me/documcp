# Design Decisions

Key architectural and design decisions made in documcp.

## Technology Stack

### Why TypeScript?

We chose TypeScript for:
- Strong type safety
- Excellent tooling support
- Large ecosystem of libraries
- Good performance characteristics
- Team familiarity

### Framework Selection

After evaluating multiple options, we selected our current stack based on:
- Community support and documentation
- Performance benchmarks
- Learning curve for new developers
- Long-term maintenance considerations

## Architectural Patterns

### Repository Pattern

We implement the repository pattern for data access:
- **Benefit**: Abstracts data source details
- **Trade-off**: Additional abstraction layer
- **Rationale**: Enables easy switching between data sources

### Service Layer

Business logic is encapsulated in services:
- **Benefit**: Reusable business logic
- **Trade-off**: More files and complexity
- **Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns

### Dependency Injection

We use dependency injection throughout:
- **Benefit**: Improved testability and flexibility
- **Trade-off**: Initial setup complexity
- **Rationale**: Essential for large-scale applications

## API Design

### RESTful vs GraphQL

We chose REST because:
- Simpler to implement and understand
- Better caching strategies
- Fits our use case well
- Lower operational complexity

### Versioning Strategy

API versioning through URL paths:
- **Format**: /api/v1/resource
- **Benefit**: Clear version boundaries
- **Trade-off**: URL complexity
- **Rationale**: Industry standard approach

## Database Decisions

### SQL vs NoSQL

We use SQL for:
- ACID compliance requirements
- Complex relational data
- Mature tooling and expertise
- Predictable performance

### Migration Strategy

Database migrations are managed through:
- Version-controlled migration files
- Automated migration on deployment
- Rollback capabilities
- Data validation steps

## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid

Our testing approach follows the test pyramid:
- Many unit tests (fast, isolated)
- Some integration tests (component interaction)
- Few E2E tests (full system validation)

### Coverage Goals

- Unit test coverage: 80% minimum
- Critical path coverage: 100%
- Integration test coverage: Key workflows

## Performance Decisions

### Caching Strategy

Multi-level caching approach:
- Application-level caching
- Database query caching
- CDN for static assets
- Redis for session data

### Async Processing

Background jobs for:
- Email sending
- Report generation
- Data processing
- Third-party integrations

## Security Decisions

### Authentication Method

JWT tokens because:
- Stateless authentication
- Scalable across services
- Standard implementation
- Good library support

### Data Encryption

- Passwords: bcrypt with salt rounds
- Sensitive data: AES-256 encryption
- Communications: TLS 1.3
- Secrets: Environment variables

## Future Considerations

### Microservices

Currently monolithic, but designed for potential splitting:
- Clear module boundaries
- Service-oriented architecture
- Database per service capability
- API gateway ready

### Cloud Native

Prepared for cloud deployment:
- 12-factor app principles
- Container-ready architecture
- Environment-based configuration
- Stateless design
