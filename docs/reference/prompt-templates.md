| ---------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `[PROJECT_TYPE]` | Type of project       | library, application, tool        |
| `[LANGUAGE]`     | Programming language  | TypeScript, Python, Go            |
| `[SSG_NAME]`     | Static site generator | Docusaurus, Hugo, MkDocs          |
| `[DOMAIN_NAME]`  | Custom domain         | docs.example.com                  |
| `[FRAMEWORK]`    | Framework used        | React, Vue, Django                |

## Best Practices for Prompting

### Effective Prompt Structure

1. **Be Specific:** Include relevant details about your project
2. **Set Context:** Mention your experience level and constraints
3. **Define Success:** Explain what a good outcome looks like
4. **Ask for Explanation:** Request reasoning behind recommendations

### Example of Well-Structured Prompt

```
I have a TypeScript library for data visualization with 50+ contributors.
I need comprehensive documentation that includes:
- API reference for all public methods
- Interactive examples with code samples
- Getting started guide for developers
- Contribution guidelines for the community

Please analyze my repository, recommend the best approach, and set up a
documentation system that can handle our scale and complexity.
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Too vague:** "help with documentation"
- **Missing context:** Not mentioning project type or requirements
- **No constraints:** Not specifying limitations or preferences
- **Single-step thinking:** Not considering the full workflow

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Git Hooks Integration

```
set up pre-commit hooks to:
- validate documentation changes
- check for broken links
- ensure content quality
- update generated content
```

### CI/CD Integration

```
create GitHub Actions workflow that:
- validates documentation on every PR
- deploys docs on main branch updates
- runs quality checks automatically
- notifies team of issues
```

### IDE Integration

```
configure development environment for:
- live documentation preview
- automated link checking
- content validation
- template generation
```

## Troubleshooting Prompts

### When Things Don't Work

**Analysis Issues:**

```
